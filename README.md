# Association-Rule-of-Employee-Attrition

This project is going to analyze the employee_attrition.csv, which contains the detailed information of each employee, such as age, department, education, whether they will stay at the company (attrition), etc. The analysis process is as followsï¼š 

- <b>Data cleaning, pre-processing:</b> Judge the necessity of variables, deal NAs and outlier with appropriate methods.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): descriptive statistics and apply data visualization to check for interesting data patterns.
- Run association rule mining algorithm using default settings as a baseline model.
- Fine tune the model by experimenting with different algorithm hyper-parameters and discuss how tuning those hyper-parameters could impact the model performance (e.g. overfitting or underfiting).
- Output and present the top 5 rules which predict those who stay vs. who leave.
- Provide interpretations of the above chosen association rules and also discuss why you consider them interesting and significant.
- Develop a web app to host the analytics process.

Some plotly graph cannot displayed, it's better use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to view the plot.
